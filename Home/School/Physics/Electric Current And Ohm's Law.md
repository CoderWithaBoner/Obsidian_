# Part 1

## Electric Current

Contains *atoms*, *nuclues*...that *electrons* revolve around

Electricity means electrons leave it's nuclues and moves to the next..then the next etc...

That's electricity they call it *flow of electrons*, *flow of charges* or *flow of electricity*

### First rule 

#### Quantity Charges $(Q)$ 

##### $Q=n×ē$

Quantity means

> the amount or number of something, especially that can be measured

$(n)$ is *Number of electrons*

$(ē)$ is *election charges*  $(CONSTANT)$
$
\begin{multline}
\downarrow
\end{multline}
$


##### $ē=1.6×10^{-19} Coulomb$

Coloumb is a scientist that discovered the electron unit



$(n)$ isn't the only thing that affects electricity 

but $(t)$ also affects it

### Second Rule
#### Electric Current Intensity $(I)$

##### $I=\dfrac{Q}{t}$

Intensity means:

> the measurable amount of a property, such as force, brightness, or a magnetic field.

Or 

شده

*The less* $(t)$ *the faster* the electricity 
*The more* $(Q)$ *the stronger potential and more electrons*

==If both are this way that increases the $(I)$==


Remember $(Q)$ unit is Coulomb when we add time and calculate it it becomes $(I)$ , its unit is $Coulomb/sec$ or $Ampere$



### Direction 

#### Traditional Current

##### Electrons move from $+ve$ to $-ve$
![[Traditional current.excalidraw]]


#### Real Current 

###### Electrons move from $-ve$ to $+ve$

# Part 2

## Voltage

### First RuleRule


#### Electro Magnetic Force $(e.m.f)$

#### Potential Difference $(V)$

##### $V=\dfrac{W}{Q}$

*Where $(W)$ is Work in $Joule$*

### Work 

The battery produces $(W)$ to move the electrons$(Q)$

$Joule$ is the unit for *Energy* and *Work*
